	01:20	works
	Notes:	Struggling finding a memory access error in function geth(),
	that i thought it occurred during backtraking, but the wrong call
	was in the printsol(), becaused passed "currsol" instead of "bestsol"

es2:	1:00	Works(?)
	Notes:	2 test cases failed online, but for me it's wrong the online
	compiler.
